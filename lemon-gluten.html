        <h7> The Gluten-free Austrian </h7>
        <p>
            Light and fluffy Gluten Free Lemon Cupcakes filled with bright and tangy lemon curd and topped with a delicious cream cheese frosting. The lemon cupcakes are a simple adaptation of everyone's favorite one bowl gluten free vanilla cupcakes. Their texture is just out of this world and everyone will question if these cupcakes are really gluten-free. Yes, they are this good. Then let's not forget my delicious homemade lemon curd for the filling and a thick (and not too sweet) cream cheese frosting to bring it all together.

        <h7> GLUTEN FREE LEMON CUPCAKE RECIPE – BEST EVER! </h7>
        <p>
            These aren’t just any old lemon cupcakes, oh no! The moist sponge of each cupcake is packed with lemon zest/juice AND there’s homemade lemon curd of the middle of each one? Plus, you’ve also got the loveliest, light and fluffy lemon buttercream on top, finished with a little lemon zest. </p>

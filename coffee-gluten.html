            These Coffee Cupcakes are tender, moist, fluffy, and have perfect and delicious coffee flavor. They are eggless, buttery, have soft crumbs, and are topped with light coffee whipped cream frosting!

            A friend of mine recently had a birthday and she loves coffee cake, but she started on a gluten free diet for health reasons a few months ago. So I decided it was time to come up with a tasty gluten free coffee cake recipe.

            My Gluten Free Coffee and Walnut Cake is easy, absolutely delicious and you’d never know it was gluten free. The coffee flavoured, fluffy cupcakes have little pieces of walnut mixed through. They’re topped with velvetty rich, coffee buttercream and I love them.

        <h7> Gluten-Free Chocolate Cupcakes </h7>
        <p>
           This recipe is so easy to make and yet tastes so amazing! The trick is to use high quality chocolate by Ghirardelli for bold flavor and a rich texture. They’re also perfect for any Holiday occasion. Since they’re gluten free, everyone can enjoy them! And trust me, even those who still eat gluten will never know these are gluten free.
